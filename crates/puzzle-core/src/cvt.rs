//! Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation (CVT) layout builder.
//!
//! Produces a [`PuzzleLayout`] whose pieces are the Voronoi cells of
//! `piece_count` seed points scattered inside a closed boundary, after
//! Lloyd relaxation has driven the seeds toward a centroidal
//! arrangement (cells roughly uniform in area, convex, boundary-
//! respecting).
//!
//! The algorithm in outline:
//!
//! 1. Flatten the boundary once to a polygon at a fixed tolerance.
//! 2. Rejection-sample `piece_count` initial seed points uniformly
//!    inside the bounding rectangle, keeping only those inside the
//!    boundary polygon.
//! 3. For `lloyd_iterations` iterations: build the Voronoi diagram over
//!    the current seeds (using the `voronoice` crate), clip each cell
//!    to the boundary polygon via `linesweeper`, compute the centroid
//!    of the clipped polygon, move the seed to that centroid.
//! 4. Build one final Voronoi, clip every cell to the boundary, extract
//!    internal edges by finding shared polygon edges between neighbor
//!    cells, emit [`LayoutEdge`]s and [`LayoutPiece`]s with cell
//!    polygons cached as outlines.
//! 5. Generate connectors on every internal edge via
//!    [`PuzzleLayout::generate_connectors`].
//!
//! Determinism: two [`ChaCha8Rng`] streams are used —
//! `"{seed}-positions"` for the initial scatter and `"{seed}-connectors"`
//! (inside `generate_connectors`) for tab randomization. Lloyd itself is
//! a purely geometric fixed-point iteration, no RNG.
