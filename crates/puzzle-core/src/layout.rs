//! Algorithm-agnostic puzzle layout — the common contract every
//! piece-generation algorithm populates and every consumer reads.
//!
//! Rectangular grid, centroidal Voronoi, hex, Penrose … each becomes a
//! single `build_*_layout(config) -> PuzzleLayout` function. Connector
//! generation, SVG export, binary export, and the WASM bridge don't
//! branch on which algorithm produced the layout — they walk the same
//! `outer_boundary` + `edges` + `pieces` structure.
//!
//! Piece outlines are **derived**: the union of `outer_boundary` and the
//! `LayoutEdge` list fully defines every piece's cut path. Individual
//! piece contours can be assembled by walking a piece's `edge_indices`
//! in adjacency order, but the layout does not store them redundantly
//! (except for algorithms like CVT where the builder already has a
//! polygon in hand — see `LayoutPiece::outline`).
