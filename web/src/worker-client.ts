/**
 * Main-thread client for `regen-worker.ts`.
 *
 * Wraps the postMessage protocol in Promise-returning calls. Stateful
 * request management:
 *
 * - `requestBuild` is **coalescing**: if a build is already in flight
 *   when a new one arrives, the in-flight one's result is discarded
 *   on arrival and the latest queued one is sent. Only the *most
 *   recent* build's result reaches the caller. Implementation: when
 *   a new build comes in, the previous unresolved promise is
 *   immediately rejected with `BUILD_SUPERSEDED` so callers can
 *   distinguish "ignore this result" from real failures.
 *
 * - `requestShapeUnitPath` and `requestCachedSvg` are sequential —
 *   they queue normally and resolve in order. They're rare (one per
 *   whimsy creation, one per SVG download) so coalescing isn't worth
 *   the added complexity.
